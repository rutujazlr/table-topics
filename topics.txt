A penny for your thoughts
A perfect storm
A penny saved is a penny earned
Action speak louder than words
A little learning is a dangerous thing
A stitch in time saves nine
An apple a day keeps the doctor away
Bolt from the blue
Break the ice
Birds of a feather flock together
Break a leg
Comparing apples to oranges
Calm before the storm
Curiosity killed the cat
Don’t beat a dead horse
Don’t cry over spilt milk
Don’t put all your eggs in one basket
Every cloud has a silver lining
Every dog has his day
Fortune favours the bold
Get your act together
Get out of hand
Get a taste of your own medicine
Good things come to those who wait
Hit the nail on the head
Hang in there
It’s not rocket science
Ignorance is bliss
Jump on the bandwagon
Know which way the wind is blowing
Kill two birds with one stone
Look before you leap
Let someone off the hook
Make a long story short
Make hay while the sun shines
No pain, no gain
On cloud nine
Once in a blue moon
Play devil’s advocate
Pull someone’s leg
Rain on someone’s parade
Run like the wind
Saving for a rainy day
So far so good
Take a rain check
The ball is in your court
Throw caution to the wind
Through thick and thin
Under the weather
We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it
We see eye to eye
You can catch more flies with honey than you can with vinegar
You can’t judge a book by its cover
